## Overview

What makes scholarly editing at HC MID both distinctive and significant?  There is more to be said about each of the points listed here, but these bullets summarize some of the most important answers to that question that have emerged from a decade of scholarly editing at HC MID.

### Method

- all work is collaborative
- all work is version controlled
- all content is canonically citable
- all editorial teams validate and verify their work

### Content

- editions in different formats (e.g., Markdown, or different XML vocabularies) are converted to the independent model of an ordered hierarchy of citation objects (OHCO2)
- citable passages of text are indexed to citable visual evidence
- texts are evaluated against a defined orthogaphic system that:
    - defines a valid set of characters
    - defines a valid set of token types (e.g., punctuation marks, alphabetic characters, numeric characters)
    - parses a text into a list of tokens paired with a token type

## Getting started

In the spring semester of 2021, we are introducing a new, simplified software stack for our editorial work.  The links below will show you how to [install the prerequisites on your computer](./prereqs/), and how your team can [set up an editorial repository](./setup).

If you've already done this, you can jump straight to [learning how to work on an MID project](./workflow/).

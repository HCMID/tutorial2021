# Setting up a repository

Your editing repository needs to

1. organize your work in directories following HC MID conventions.
2. add configuration entries for each text you edit.  


Normally, your team will do this set up once and never need to pay attention to it again once you start editing, but remember that if you start to work in the same repository on new texts, you'll need to add configuration entries for them.

You can also [refer to these instructions](./update/) if you need to update the copy of the validating notebook in your repository.
